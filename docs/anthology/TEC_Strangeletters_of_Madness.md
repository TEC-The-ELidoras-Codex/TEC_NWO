# TEC: Strangeletters of Madness

An anthology framing for Elidoras: cabinet‑of‑curiosities horror told through letters, logs, rites, and broadcast fragments from a disturbed psyche inside the Astradigital. Each entry is self‑contained, canon‑aware, and tagged for reuse by agents.

Purpose

- Provide a reusable structure to encode Season‑style arcs (inspired by The Strain S1/S2 analysis) as TEC tales
- Standardize tags for themes: ritual, hope, fracture, prison logic, rewrite, innocence, guardian, feast
