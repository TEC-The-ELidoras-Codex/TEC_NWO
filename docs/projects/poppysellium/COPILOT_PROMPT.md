# Poppysellium Project & Cyberpunk Confessional — Copilot Instructions

Date: 2025-08-23 (America/New_York)

Overview

This Copilot prompt sets up a TEC initiative that merges two deliverables:

1) Poppysellium character prompt for TECIE’A (image engine)
   - Undead spore princess; sister to Airth the Fifth
   - Palette: blue–green; chocolate-tone necroskin with cyan–green bioluminescent fungal scars
   - Heterochromia: one glowing blue eye, one mossy green eye
   - Bioluminescent braids; spore vents on fingers; regal fungal silk gown with necro-vines
   - Background: moss-choked tech ruins, cyan–green sporelight, glitching billboards
   - Mood: haunting yet regal; low-angle 35mm cinematic hero shot; sporepunk + necrobotanical couture

2) Cyberpunk Confessional (lore article)
   - Restructure a 30-minute transcript into “Hallucinating with God in the Machine: A Cyberpunk Confessional”
   - Beat-poem/monologue format: prologue → themed sections → epilogue
   - Themes: psychedelics, survival, self-education, simulation — respect TEC Axioms
   - Include contextual footnotes and safety/historical references (below)
