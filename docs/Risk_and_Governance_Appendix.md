# Risk & Governance Appendix (XenoEmergence)

Scope

- Collect pragmatic governance planks to anchor TEC policy fights and operational safeguards.
- Paraphrase first‑party sources to avoid over‑reliance on hype; cite CACM for credibility.

Key planks (paraphrased)

1. Integrity and labeling [3]

- Media provenance and verification must be machine‑verifiable and human‑auditable.
- Labels without enforcement and transparency are theater; publish methods and failure cases.

1. Security and autonomy boundaries [1]

- Treat autonomy edges as safety‑critical: constrain action spaces; require explicit human confirmation for irreversible effects.
- Monitor for accident classes (spec drift, data poisoning, feedback loops) with red‑team drills.

1. Bias and harm mitigation [1]

- Ship with documented limitations; enable contestation and appeal.
- Measure outcomes, not intent; publish disparity metrics and remediation paths.

1. Operating within limits [2]

- Energy, bandwidth, and material constraints are inputs to architecture; optimize for graceful degradation, not peak benchmarks.
- Prefer local‑first and cache‑heavy designs; document failure modes and offline SOPs.

1. Accountability and transparency [3]

- Public‑facing systems must expose decision traces and data lineage.
- Use immutable versioning (git + optional chain anchoring) and sign artifacts.

Implementation hooks in TEC

- AxiomEngine gating on public releases; publish compliance summaries with each brief.
- Memory Core provenance manifests attached to assets; commit hash and toolchain versions in footer.
- RAG cost and risk gating (ENABLE_RAG) with on‑call playbooks and spend thresholds.

Notes

- These planks are in‑universe policy stances; adapt language for briefs and dashboards. Avoid direct quotes; prefer paraphrase with citations.
