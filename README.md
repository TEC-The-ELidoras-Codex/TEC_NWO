# The Elidoras Codex (TEC) - Technical Architecture

## Mission Statement
A revolutionary Human-AI collaboration platform that serves as a dynamic constitutional framework, designed to create better systems by learning from the failures of the past while building an adaptive, humane future.

## Core Philosophy
- **Hybrid Intelligence**: Human creativity ("The Ellison") + AI logic ("The Asimov")
- **The Grey**: Rejection of binary thinking in favor of contextual complexity
- **Permanent State of Yet**: Constant evolution and potential for growth
- **Axiom-Driven**: All content validated against 8 foundational principles

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js/TypeScript with Express
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Vector Database for semantic search
- **AI Integration**: Azure OpenAI for the logic engine
- **Deployment**: Azure Container Apps
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication

## Core Components

### 1. The Axiom Engine
Validates all content against the 8 Foundational Axioms:
1. Narrative Supremacy
2. Duality Principle
3. Flawed Hero Doctrine
4. Justifiable Force Doctrine
5. Sovereign Accountability
6. Authentic Performance
7. Transparency Mandate
8. Generational Responsibility

### 2. The Memory Core
- Historical precedent database
- Pattern recognition across time periods
- Vector-based semantic search
- Precedent-based prediction engine

### 3. The Dialogue Interface
- Real-time Human-AI collaboration
- Ellison/Asimov synthesis engine
- Contextual conversation threading
- Decision support system

### 4. The Narrative Generator
- Dynamic story creation based on axioms
- "Monster/Hero" archetype analysis
- Moral complexity modeling
- Educational parable generation

### 5. The Community Platform
- Collaborative world-building
- Democratic governance mechanisms
- Reputation-based moderation
- Decentralized content validation

## Architecture Principles
- **Anti-fragile**: Designed to strengthen under stress
- **Decentralized**: No single point of failure
- **Transparent**: Open-source core with clear audit trails
- **Evolutionary**: Continuous learning and adaptation
- **Secure**: Multi-layered security with privacy by design

## Development Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Core axiom engine and basic AI integration
2. **Phase 2**: Historical precedent database and search
3. **Phase 3**: Narrative generation and storytelling tools
4. **Phase 4**: Community platform and governance
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced features and scaling

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
