# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The Elidoras Codex is currently in active development. We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Philosophy

In alignment with our **Transparency Mandate** axiom, we believe in radical transparency about security practices while maintaining necessary protections. Our security approach is built on the principle that true security comes from openness, not obscurity.

### Core Security Principles

1. **Transparency by Default**: All security practices are documented and open to community review
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security protection
3. **Privacy by Design**: User privacy is built into the system architecture, not added as an afterthought
4. **Decentralized Resilience**: No single point of failure in our security model
5. **Community Vigilance**: Security is a collective responsibility

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to security@elidorascodex.org
2. **PGP Key**: Available at https://elidorascodex.org/pgp-key.asc
3. **GitHub Security Advisory**: For non-critical issues, use GitHub's security advisory feature

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if any)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Regular Updates**: Every 7 days until resolution
- **Resolution Timeline**: Varies by severity (see below)

## Severity Classification

### Critical (Fix within 24-48 hours)
- Remote code execution
- Complete system compromise
- Axiom engine manipulation allowing harmful content
- Unauthorized admin access

### High (Fix within 1 week)
- User data exposure
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation
- AI model manipulation

### Medium (Fix within 2 weeks)
- Information disclosure
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Memory corruption

### Low (Fix within 1 month)
- Information leakage
- Minor logic flaws
- Configuration issues
- Documentation vulnerabilities

## Security Measures

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive communications
- Zero-knowledge architecture where possible
- Regular data purging of temporary information
- Secure key management using industry standards

### Infrastructure Security
- Container-based deployment with minimal attack surface
- Regular security updates and patches
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Network segmentation and monitoring

### AI Model Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output filtering and validation
- Model versioning and rollback capabilities
- Continuous monitoring for model drift or manipulation

### Community Security
- Open-source codebase for community review
- Regular security audits
- Bug bounty program (details TBA)
- Security-focused code reviews

## Threat Model

### Primary Threats
1. **Malicious Content Generation**: Attempts to manipulate the AI to generate harmful content
2. **Axiom Circumvention**: Efforts to bypass the foundational ethical constraints
3. **Data Poisoning**: Injection of biased or harmful training data
4. **Social Engineering**: Attacks targeting community members and maintainers
5. **Infrastructure Compromise**: Traditional cybersecurity attacks on our systems

### Mitigation Strategies
- Multi-layered content validation
- Immutable axiom storage with cryptographic verification
- Diverse data sources and validation pipelines
- Security awareness training for all contributors
- Hardened infrastructure with continuous monitoring

## Incident Response

### Response Team
- Lead Security Officer
- Technical Response Team
- Community Relations
- Legal Counsel (when necessary)

### Response Process
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and community reporting
2. **Assessment**: Severity classification and impact analysis
3. **Containment**: Immediate steps to prevent further damage
4. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis and evidence collection
5. **Resolution**: Fix deployment and verification
6. **Recovery**: System restoration and monitoring
7. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and process improvement

## Security Audits

We conduct regular security audits of our systems:

- **Internal Audits**: Monthly automated scans and quarterly manual reviews
- **External Audits**: Annual third-party security assessments
- **Community Audits**: Ongoing peer review of open-source code
- **AI Ethics Audits**: Quarterly review of AI model behavior and alignment

## Compliance

While The Elidoras Codex operates as an open platform, we adhere to relevant security standards:

- SOC 2 Type II compliance for infrastructure
- GDPR compliance for user data protection
- Industry best practices for AI safety and security
- Regular compliance audits and certifications

## Contact Information

- **General Security**: security@elidorascodex.org
- **Security Team Lead**: security-lead@elidorascodex.org
- **Emergency Hotline**: Available to verified contributors

## Legal Safe Harbor

We support security researchers acting in good faith:

- No legal action for security research conducted in accordance with this policy
- Recognition for responsible disclosure
- Potential monetary rewards for significant vulnerabilities (program TBA)

*"True security comes not from hiding our vulnerabilities, but from building systems robust enough to withstand scrutiny and strong enough to protect what matters most."*

**Note**: This security policy is a living document that evolves with our understanding of threats and best practices. All changes are publicly documented and community-reviewed.
