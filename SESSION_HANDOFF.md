# SESSION HANDOFF – TEC SOVEREIGN STATE SNAPSHOT

Timestamp: <!-- UTC -->

## Core Thesis
The Guardian’s Burden anchors moral axis; Order of the Fuck-Up Fathers supplies resilience doctrine. Narrative sovereignty enforced via Axiom Engine + Memory Core + Dialogue layer.

## Operational State
| Subsystem | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| TypeScript Core | ✅ | tsc clean |
| Python MCP Server | ✅ | Axiom + Dialogue modules import fine |
| ThoughtMap GUI (Phase 1) | ✅ | Manual node add/save/load working |
| LFS Tracking | ✅ | Media patterns applied (.m4a/.mp4 etc.) |
| Repo Size | ⚠️ ~764MB | History bloat unresolved |
| Sovereign Assets | Partial | Indexed, not fully cross-linked |

## Decision Log (Pending / Executed)
1. Nuclear history purge: APPROVED (user confirmed) – NOT YET EXECUTED (awaiting final safety confirmation)
2. Phase 2 priority: Proceed with ThoughtMap AI expansion first, then MCP enrichment
3. Local model vs remote API: DEFER – stub stays deterministic until architecture choice

## Next Task Checklist
- [x] Decide purge now vs later (recorded APPROVED, execution pending)
- [x] Implement ThoughtMap Phase 2 AI expansion stubs (Python module extraction pending commit)
- [ ] Wire Ctrl+Space hotkey to expansion (pending module extraction)
- [ ] Persist save format version bump (schemaVersion: 2 in new save routine)
- [ ] MCP adapter: connect to real graph instead of dummy
- [x] Pre-commit large file guard (>10MB unless LFS tracked)
- [ ] Lightweight Jest smoke test + Python self-test script

## Interfaces Planned
### Python Expansion Stub
`expand_node(text: str, strategy: str = "concept" ) -> list[str]`
Returns list of plausible child node titles (mock until model configured).

### Synthesis
`synthesize_branch(node_id) -> { summary: str, sources: list[node_id] }`

## MCP Adapter Skeleton
`python tools/mcp_thoughtmap_adapter.py --export thoughtmap.json` produces JSON payload ready for Memory Core route (future POST endpoint).

## Risk Notes
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| History purge irreversible | Create archive tag before rewrite |
| Large binary accidentally committed | Pre-commit size + ensure LFS patterns |
| Model hallucination in expansion | Keep stub deterministic until validation layer added |

## Suggested Order of Operations (If Continuing Immediately)
1. Extract ThoughtMap notebook code into module + hotkey
2. Execute nuclear purge (after commit) OR postpone
3. Replace MCP adapter dummy with live exporter
4. Add synthesis UI action (branch summary)
5. Decide model integration path (Azure vs local) and implement

## Handoff Prompt (For New Chat Seed)
```
ROLE: Sovereign Assistant | Resume TEC Session
CONTEXT: Partial sovereignty complete | LFS active | Repo size 764MB | ThoughtMap Phase 1 running | Need Phase 2 AI + decision on nuclear purge.
PRINCIPLE: The Guardian’s Burden central moral axis.
NEEDS:
1. Confirm whether to execute nuclear purge now.
2. Implement ThoughtMap Phase 2: expand_node + synthesize_branch.
3. Prepare adapter to MCP memory (export node graph).
4. Add safeguards: pre-commit LFS enforcement.
RETURN: Step plan + minimal code stubs (Python + TS) + risk notes.
```

## To Update After Next Session
Add Decisions Executed + Updated Status table.
