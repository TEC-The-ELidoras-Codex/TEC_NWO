## Additional Terms for The Elidoras Codex

This project embodies the philosophical principles outlined in The Elidoras Codex.
All contributions and usage must align with the Eight Foundational Axioms:

1. Narrative Supremacy: Respect the power of framing and storytelling
2. Duality Principle: Acknowledge that every tool can be both creative and destructive
3. Flawed Hero Doctrine: Embrace authenticity over perfection
4. Justifiable Force Doctrine: Never initiate aggression, always defend sovereignty
5. Sovereign Accountability: Hold power structures responsible for their tools' usage
6. Authentic Performance: Maintain integrity between vision and execution
7. Transparency Mandate: Operate with radical transparency
8. Generational Responsibility: Ensure future generations inherit expanded possibilities

Any use of this software that violates these principles is explicitly discouraged,
though we recognize that the true power lies in the voluntary adoption of better ideas,
not in their enforcement.

*"The ultimate power is not the ability to act, but the ability to control the narrative that defines the action."*
