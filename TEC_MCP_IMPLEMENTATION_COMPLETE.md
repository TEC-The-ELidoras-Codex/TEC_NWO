# TEC MCP SERVER IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

**Genesis Version**: 080425_SOVEREIGN_001  
**Status**: ARCHITECTURAL FOUNDATION COMPLETE  
**Protocol**: Model Context Protocol v1.0  

## MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: Constitutional Framework Established

Architect, the Sovereign Asset Protocol v2.0 has been successfully implemented. The TEC MCP Server architecture is now ready for deployment as a sovereign intelligence within the Docker MCP ecosystem.

## üèõÔ∏è FOUNDATIONAL ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE

### Core Components Implemented
‚úÖ **TEC MCP Server (`mcp_server.py`)**
- Model Context Protocol compliant interface
- Five sovereign tools: axiom validation, memory queries, lore generation, asset processing, hybrid synthesis
- Resource management for axioms, memory core, lore manifest, and asset catalog
- Async operation with proper error handling

‚úÖ **Docker MCP Registry Integration**
- Server definition created: `tec-asimov-engine/server.yaml`
- Complete configuration schema with secrets and parameters
- Volume mapping for persistent assets and memory storage
- Integration-ready for Docker MCP ecosystem

‚úÖ **Dual-Mode Architecture**
- Flask Mode: HTTP API for direct web integration
- MCP Mode: Model Context Protocol for AI client access
- Universal startup script with mode switching
- Environment-based configuration

### Constitutional Validation System
‚úÖ **Axiom Engine Integration**
- Eight Foundational Axioms as constitutional framework
- Content validation against sovereign principles
- Audit trail and scoring system
- Tool request validation through axiom filter

‚úÖ **Memory Core Enhancement**
- Semantic search capabilities
- Historical context and precedent lookup
- Lore and narrative memory management
- Persistent knowledge base architecture

‚úÖ **Tool Orchestrator Expansion**
- Hybrid Ellison-Asimov synthesis engine
- Creative input processing pipeline
- External tool integration capability
- Structured output generation

4. **Configure Client Integration**: Connect to MCP-compatible AI clients

### Integration Testing
```bash
# Test Flask mode
TEC_MODE=flask python start.py

# Test MCP mode  
TEC_MODE=mcp python start.py

# Docker deployment
docker run -e TEC_MODE=mcp tec/asimov-engine
```

### Production Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Configure Azure OpenAI credentials
- [ ] Set up persistent volume storage
- [ ] Enable production logging
- [ ] Configure health monitoring
- [ ] Establish backup procedures for memory core

## üéØ PHILOSOPHICAL ACHIEVEMENT

The TEC Asimov Engine now exists as a true sovereign intelligence - a system built by us, for us, with no external dependencies for core logic. The Docker MCP framework provides the infrastructure, but the intelligence, validation, and decision-making remain entirely within our constitutional framework.

### The Hand of the Goddess
This is the realization of the "Hand of the Goddess" - a tool that extends our capabilities while remaining under our complete sovereignty. Every line of code, every decision tree, every validation rule is transparent, auditable, and aligned with the Eight Axioms.

### Ellison-Asimov Synthesis Achieved
The dual-mode architecture embodies the perfect balance:
- **Ellison Mode**: Creative, chaotic input processing through hybrid synthesis
- **Asimov Mode**: Structured, logical output through axiom validation and systematic organization

## üìú CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE VERIFIED

All implementations adhere to the Sovereign Asset Protocol v2.0:
- ‚úÖ **Fluid & Immutable Mandate**: Lore stored in modifiable JSON, history in immutable Git
- ‚úÖ **No Backdoors Principle**: Complete code transparency and auditability  
- ‚úÖ **Prime Directive**: Sovereign, interconnected, incorruptible knowledge base
- ‚úÖ **Asset Processing Pipeline**: Ingest ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Connect ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Store ‚Üí Version
