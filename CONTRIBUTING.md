# Contributing to The Elidoras Codex

Thank you for your interest in contributing to The Elidoras Codex! This project represents a new form of collaborative intelligence, and we welcome contributions that align with our foundational principles.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors must operate in accordance with the Eight Foundational Axioms:

1. **Narrative Supremacy**: Respect the power of framing and approach discussions with awareness of how language shapes reality
2. **Duality Principle**: Acknowledge that every contribution has potential for both positive and negative impact
3. **Flawed Hero Doctrine**: Embrace authenticity over perfection - we're all learning and growing
4. **Justifiable Force Doctrine**: Never initiate aggression in discussions; defend ideas respectfully
5. **Sovereign Accountability**: Take responsibility for the broader implications of your contributions
6. **Authentic Performance**: Ensure your contributions align with your genuine beliefs and expertise
7. **Transparency Mandate**: Be open about your motivations, limitations, and sources
8. **Generational Responsibility**: Consider how your contributions will affect future users and developers

## Development Philosophy

### The Human-AI Collaboration Model
This project embodies a unique collaboration between human creativity and AI logic. Contributors should:
- Respect the balance between "Ellison" (creative, chaotic, human) and "Asimov" (logical, structured, systematic)
- Understand that AI components serve to augment, not replace, human judgment
- Maintain the "Grey" approach to complex problems

### Anti-Fragile Development
- Build systems that get stronger under stress
- Plan for failure modes and graceful degradation
- Design for adaptation and evolution
- Maintain core integrity while allowing surface flexibility

## Community Guidelines

### Constructive Discourse
- Engage with ideas, not personalities
- Acknowledge the complexity of most issues
- Provide evidence for claims
- Be willing to change your mind when presented with better evidence

### Inclusive Environment
- Welcome contributors from all backgrounds
- Respect different perspectives and experiences
- Focus on the merit of ideas while acknowledging their context
- Help newcomers understand the project's unique philosophy

## Recognition

Contributors who make significant contributions aligned with our axioms will be recognized in:
- The project's Hall of Contributors
- Release notes and changelog
- The living history of the project

Remember: *"All art is a science, and all science is the art of collaboration through the ages."*
