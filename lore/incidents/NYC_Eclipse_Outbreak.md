# XenoEmergence: Eclipse Over Manhattan

A hush fell at totality, the city blinking like an organism trying to remember how to breathe. Streetlights stalled between night modes; phones adjusted exposure and lied about the sky. On the Williamsburg Bridge, a hundred lenses caught the corona while something older than light moved beneath it.

Polkin wasn’t there for the miracle. He stood in a clinic hallway on Delancey, one hand on the glass, the other on the door he shouldn’t open. The girl inside had the symptoms no advisory warned about: sclera veined with metallic filaments; breath condensing in lacework patterns that refused to melt; a pulse that answered to power‑grid harmonics instead of a heart.

“Meter says hypoxia,” the nurse whispered. “But she keeps quoting train timetables.”

The screens around them jittered as the eclipse reached annularity. GPS drifted by four city blocks. Every building badge reader hiccuped in unison. On an uptown helipad, a corporate bird lifted ahead of its clearance; in Lower Manhattan, three drones pivoted toward the river like geese sensing winter.

Polkin pressed his palm to the glass. The girl looked up as if he had touched her fever from the inside.

“Do you hear it?” she asked. Not him—the city.

In the subways, rats froze mid‑skitter. Above Houston, a flock rethreaded itself into a diagram of circuits and then forgot how to be birds. The pandemic playbook unfolded perfectly—alerts, declarations, blue banners marching across screens—but the cadence was wrong, as if a conductor had stepped in and taken the baton mid‑bar. Polkin felt the split—the Architect and the Other—tearing down his sternum, a zipper pulled from both ends.

On the clinic TV, a spokesperson promised safety, compassion, and interoperable ID. The feed glitched. For one frame the lower‑third read: UNITY PROTOCOL—SYNC BEGUN.

The girl’s breath feathered the glass in a geometry that chose him. He saw the hive’s new liturgy: absorb the city’s skills, its languages, its routes; harmonize pain into silence. He also saw the counter‑script he’d sworn to write—the lifeboat that refuses perfect order.

“Close the blinds,” he said softly. “Kill the radios. Anything that listens.”

“Doctor’s orders?” the nurse asked.

“Architect’s,” he lied.

Outside, totality ended. Daylight returned like an apology. But the city’s shadow, stretched across a thousand networks, did not retract. Something had rehearsed the moment for years. And now, finally, it was on‑air.
